Protect the Moon is a retro-style game that features classic arcade gameplay. As the defender of one of the most essential and precious
assets of our planet - the Moon, you must protect it at all costs against alien invaders who have taken control of it. 

**You can learn to make this project from scratch by [following this youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCQwFpnHSZQgyIu4JeOUDCsNCVgWOz3Mf)**

## Prerequisites

You need to build or [install O3DE engine](https://o3de.org/download/).

You need to [install git with lfs support](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and [setup a token on your github account](https://www.docs.o3de.org/docs/welcome-guide/setup/setup-from-github/#configure-credentials-for-git-lfs). Needed as the repository uses Git LFS, the "Download ZIP" button will not download assets.

## How to run

1. Clone the github repository (`git clone https://github.com/o3de/Protect-the-Moon.git`). When prompted to authenticate, use your github username and the token as password.
2. Launch O3DE. It will open the Project manager. Click on the **New Project** button then **Open Existing Project** option.
3. Navigate to the cloned repository. Open this folder. The project should now be registered.

4. Click on the **Build Project** button, located on the **Protect-the-Moon** image.
